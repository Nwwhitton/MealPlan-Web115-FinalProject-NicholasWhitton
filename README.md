# MealPlan-Web115-FinalProject-NicholasWhitton
The program lets the user input what they will eat for the next week, by creating a new window with the meal plan for the week.

Input data into the text boxes, and input a valid email to submit the form
Once the submit button is clicked it will open a new window and display the meal plan
If you enjoy the meal plan created, at the bottom of the window there is a print button.

If not, then go back to the main page and click the reset button, and it will recreate the form
